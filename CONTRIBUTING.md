## Working and contributing to the application
Create issues for feature suggestions and improvements, you can make pull requests as well. Just remember that they should stay in the theme of this application, if it's out of theme, you can head over to "Working outside Tweak Utility".

## Working outside Tweak Utility
Tweak Utility offers extensibility options, this means you can add new tweaks to Tweak Utility without supervision. Information about extensions work is located [here](/wiki/Extensions).

## Working with the installer
Tweak Utility uses at the moment the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioClient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) template.
