## Working outside the Tweak Utility
Tweak Utility offers extensibility options, this means you can add new tweaks to Tweak Utility without supervision. Information about extensions work is located [here]().

## Working with the installer
Tweak Utility uses at the moment the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioClient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) template.
